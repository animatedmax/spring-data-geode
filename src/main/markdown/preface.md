While every effort has been made to ensure this documentation is
comprehensive and complete without errors, some topics are beyond the
scope of this document and may require more explanation (for example,
data distribution management using partitioning with HA while still
preserving consistency). Additionally, some typographical errors might
have crept in. If you do spot mistakes or even more serious errors,
please bring these issues to the attention of the Spring Data team by
raising an appropriate [issue in
JIRA](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SGF).
